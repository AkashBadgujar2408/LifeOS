# LifeOS Progress Log

## Last session: 2026-10-13 — Session 1 — Solution & Angular scaffold
- Shipped:
  - `.sln` with `LifeOS.Core` (classlib) + `LifeOS.Api` (webapi, `-controllers`, .NET 10), project reference wired.
  - `LifeOS.Core`: EF Core SqlServer + Design, AutoMapper (16.x — DI extensions package dropped, obsolete now that `AddAutoMapper()` ships in the main package).
  - `LifeOS.Api`: Areas-based routing confirmed — `Areas/Shared/Controllers/PingController.cs` (`GET /api/Shared/Ping`), CORS policy for `http://localhost:4200`, default WeatherForecast template cruft removed.
  - `lifeos-web/`: Angular 22 app scaffolded **directly at repo root** (moved out of an initial `client/` folder per your instruction), standalone `App` component calls `PingService` (`core/services/ping.service.ts`) and renders the API's live message; `provideHttpClient()` wired in `app.config.ts`; dev proxy (`proxy.conf.json`, wired into `angular.json`'s serve options) forwards `/api/*` to `http://localhost:5217`.
  - End-to-end verified in an actual browser tab: page rendered "LifeOS API is alive (server time UTC: ...)".
  - Git repo initialized at the LifeOS root (did not exist before); `.gitignore` added (excludes `OkayToolsEIA4/` — separate existing repo, plus the usual `bin/obj/node_modules`).
  - `CLAUDE.md` written at repo root from the plan's Appendix B, updated with everything decided today.
  - `LifeOS_Development_Plan.md`/`.docx` updated: .NET 10 (not 8 — only 10 was installed, and it's the current LTS), database name `LifeOS_UAT` (a `LifeOS_Live` comes later), per-module SQL schemas instead of `dbo` (`shared`/`goals`/`tasks`/`calendar`/`habits`/`journal`), Dapper + stored procedures reinstated for complex/join-heavy queries (explicit SQL-learning goal — reverses the earlier "defer Dapper" deviation), Areas + per-module `Core` folder structure (mirrors `OkayToolsEIA4`'s `Areas/<Module>/Controllers` convention, confirmed), `lifeos-web` at repo root instead of under `client/`, one shared Angular layout/shell instead of per-component bespoke CSS (exception: Dashboard/Calendar where custom visuals are genuinely needed).

- Verified:
  - `dotnet build` clean, 0 warnings/errors.
  - `dotnet run --project LifeOS.Api` → `GET /api/Shared/Ping` returns `{"message":"LifeOS API is alive","serverTimeUtc":"..."}`.
  - `ng serve` (via `npx ng serve` in `lifeos-web/`) compiles and serves on `:4200`; browser-rendered page confirmed showing the live API message (not just a build check).

- Open decisions / notes for future sessions:
  - .NET 10 SDK only is installed on this machine (no .NET 8) — SDK target is `net10.0` everywhere from here on.
  - Dev servers were stopped at the end of this session (no background processes left running) — Session 2 starts by launching both again.
  - Database (`LifeOS_UAT`, schema scripts, scaffold) has **not** been created yet — that's Session 3. Nothing to scaffold yet.
  - `AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection` was added then removed — `AddAutoMapper()` now ships directly in the `AutoMapper` package (16.x); don't re-add the extensions package.
  - Windows showed a transient "address already in use" on port 5217 after killing a prior `dotnet run` — resolved itself on retry (stale socket release delay, not a real conflict). If it recurs, retry once before troubleshooting further.

- Next up: **Session 2 — Tooling & conventions.** ESLint/Prettier/strict TS in `lifeos-web`; Serilog in `LifeOS.Api`; global exception-handling middleware; standard API response envelope; Swagger UI confirmed. Also a good point to install the fixed frontend library set (Bootstrap 5, ng-bootstrap, @coreui/angular free tier, ag-Grid Community, SweetAlert2, ngx-toastr, ng2-charts, Bootstrap Icons) and build the shared Angular layout/shell.
